when kids wrote orgy on their backpacks,  
what did that mean?  
i was home alone in the evening  
googling  
found a splash screen  
that asked me  
if i was 18  
of course i'm sure  
how does the computer know when i was born  
a generation formed by internet porn

**this is just a demo m8**

**To my summer '21 TNT Team:** I lied to you folks today (it's okay, Stephanie did too! <3). I came a bit late to the meeting 'cause I stayed up late working on this blog. Love you all and love the progress we've been making. You'll see me 10 mins. early from now on.
