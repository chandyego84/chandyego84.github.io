#### VoI (John Rawls)
>Is a society more "just" when it's more free, or more equal? Imagine you were about to be born, but didn't know as whom: male or female, rich or poor, urban or rural, sick or healthy. And before learning your status you had to choose what kind of society you'd live in. What would you want?
