title: A Thought

There’s a perfect moment in space and time when my hair grows just right; the proportions are just perfect. Or when bodies moving through space, constrained by its neighbors, are in perfect alignment with one another. However, these moments last only ephemerally and are typically only fragments of the whole picture. Nonetheless, that is what makes these moments special. It is a constant struggle between order and disorder, the “asymmetry of time”..Disorder is more probable, not only in nature, but also in our lives. I think about ways to get rid of the chaos and disorder, but it just gives it more fuel. But at the end of the day, I think about what challenges the next day will bring, and out of those challenges a seed is planted in me. Whether I will nurture it so it can grow or despise it and let it wither is in my hands. The universe works in mysterious ways and I am like a pawn of it, but I can sleep knowing that “it has no obligation to make sense to me” (NDT). In other words, the motto is “just fucking deal with it”. Find a way.
