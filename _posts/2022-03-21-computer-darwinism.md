title: Self-Driving Simulation Based on Darwinism
---
### Introdction
The goal of this projec was to simulate a "self-driving" car in the Unity engine using neural networks and the genetic algorithm. The neural network was used to navigate through the track and was trained or optimized through an evolutionary process. Given a predefined path, the car's ability to drive itself was primarily based on how far it was able to move along the track without hitting another object or steering off to the side of the track. To add some more complexity, I ensured that the car had to take slight turns. 

### Neural Networks
Neural networks are the core of deep learning algorithms and both their name and structure are inspired by the human brain. The neural network is a collection of neurons that are connected to each other and can be trained to learn patterns in data. They rely on data to learn and improve their acuracy over time. If you want to learn more, this [project on recognizing handwritten digits](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) is a good place to start.
