>How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.<br>(<i>Annie Dillard</i>)

There are about [~6.62 billion people](https://www.worlddata.info/developing-countries.php) in the world who are in developing countries, or 85.22% of the world population. Another 13.62%, or 1.06 billion people, are in the lowest end of the poverty scale. As the number of [people living in extreme poverty](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute) has decreased dramatically over the past few centuries, the standards of living a fulfilling life have changed--survival has become the bare minimum in life. Modern society is about producing the most throughput and making advancements that contribute to the wellbeing of as much people as possible. This leads me to wonder which members of society are the most useful and which are the most useless, assuming that there is a distinction. If we measure usefulness in terms of how much one produces in society--defined loosely but can be any medium that improves the wellbeing of other individuals--then it would be unfair to classify the 90-some percent of people in poorer countries as useless simply because they are unable to meet even the [bare minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) needs in life.
