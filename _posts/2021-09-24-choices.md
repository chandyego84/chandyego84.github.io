{: .box-note}
Been needing to write for a while now. Don't know if it hurts more to be alone or to have my presence hurt someone else's. Here's to a crappy "poem".

There's two worlds,
the one that I see and 
the one that you see in me.
When they collide it's the peak of insecurity.
Tortures my mind, human cruelty. 

I inflict this pain for 
as long as I'm sane 
Won't tell anybody 
'Cause I don't know anybody.
Do people with nobody to hide from
still keep up boundaries?
If you weren't with me in my worst times, 
don't be with my during my best life,
but what if you had nobody in your worst state of mind?
This burden I built,
or did it build me?
Sprinting everyday like I'm gonna fall over,
but I'm still sober,
and I know I'll get over it.
I hope I'll get over it. 

God send me a sign 
Don't wanna make you my enemy.
I promise you this hate can be temporary.
What's the return on investment
The promised land 
looks more like the biggest scam,
but I'll keep inflicting this pain 
'cause I don't know anybody.
